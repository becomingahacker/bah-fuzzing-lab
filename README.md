# bah-foundations-lab

Becoming a Hacker Foundations Lab running on Cisco Modeling Labs

## Create Labs

* Edit `config.yml` and set `pod_count` to the desired count.
* Run `tofu apply`

```
tofu apply
```

Labs will be created, along with pod users, groups and passwords.

* After the labs are created, get the usernames and passwords with 
  `tofu output`:

```
tofu output -json | jq .cml_credentials.value
```

Example:
```
tofu output -json | jq .cml_credentials.value
{
  "pod1": "personally-cute-manatee",
  "pod2": "evidently-eternal-treefrog",
  "pod3": "plainly-trusted-crane"
} 
```

> [!NOTE]
> If you want to override the randomized passwords that are generated, create a file
> in the workspace root called `cml_credentials.json`.  The file should have the same
> format as `tofu output -json | jq .cml_credentials.value`, e.g.
>
> ```json
> {
>   "pod1": "rarely-valid-sole",
>   "pod10": "lately-settled-ghoul",
>   "pod2": "manually-artistic-penguin",
>   "pod3": "trivially-proper-chigger",
>   "pod4": "strictly-tough-burro",
>   "pod5": "neatly-sunny-crane",
>   "pod6": "thoroughly-settling-beagle",
>   "pod7": "nationally-sincere-gannet",
>   "pod8": "legally-enabled-wolf",
>   "pod9": "presumably-refined-camel"
> }
> ```
> 
> If the pod is not defined, it will get a randomly-generated password based on
> [`random_pet`](https://search.opentofu.org/provider/hashicorp/random/latest/docs/resources/pet).
> 

> You can convert this file to a CSV with `jq` to import into Google Sheets to do a mail merge.
> `jq -r '(["username", "password"], (to_entries[] | [.key, .value])) | @csv' cml_credentials.json > cml_credentials.csv`

## Bring your own IPv4

> [!IMPORTANT]
> These BYOIP (v4 and v6) networks are regional resources, and only available
> in `us-east1`.  If you move the lab to South Asia, the PDP **needs to be moved**
> as well.  Lab Engineering or an AURYN admin can help you do this.

We already have Publicly Advertised Prefixes (PAPs) and Publicly Delegated
Prefixes (PDPs) set up for `ASIG-BAH-GCP`.  The fuzzing lab now has its own
`/25` [delegated to
it](https://console.cloud.google.com/networking/byoip/list?invt=Abms5A&project=gcp-asigbahgcp-nprd-47930)
in `us-east1`. This gives us plenty of headroom for **30 pods** (and then
some) with Cisco IPs, well clear of the previous shared-/27 ceiling. This
prefix's external IPs can be used with GCE VMs or a Load Balancer:

* `172.98.18.0/25`

> [!IMPORTANT]
> A note about using BYOIPv4 and various hacks:
>
> The all-zeros "network" IP and last usable IP (`172.98.18.0` externally NATed by
> Google to the `ens5` interface and `172.98.18.126/25` on `virbr1`) are reserved
> for the CML controller.  The all-ones directed broadcast IP (`172.98.18.127`)
> can only be used for VMs (NATed by Google), and not forwarding rules, **unless**
> using as a forwarding rule for a `/32` loopback on the target device.  This
> means we have (`172.98.18.127/32`) available for general use as long as it's
> routed (e.g. with BGP or static) as a `/32` internally. Otherwise it's lost
> to that `/25` prefix according to the typical IPv4 routing behavior.

> [!WARNING]
> These IPs have a good reputation associated with them, whereas some services
> don't like GCE external IPs.  Let's make sure they stay that way!  This also
> allows for tracing incidents back to individual pods in the event of an
> incident.

Example using gloud CLI:

```
$ gcloud compute public-delegated-prefixes describe asig-bah-prod-us-east1-sub-172-98-18-0-25
byoipApiVersion: V2
description: ASIG Becoming A Hacker us-east1 IPv4 Sub-delegation
ipCidrRange: 172.98.18.0/25
kind: compute#publicDelegatedPrefix
...
status: ANNOUNCED_TO_INTERNET
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> It's not [currently possible](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-google/issues/19147)
> to create addresses from a PDP in OpenTofu.  This has to be done manually
> and should already be done for you.

## Bring your own IPv6

We already have PAPs and PDPs set up in `ASIG-BAH-GCP`.  There needs to be a 
forwarding rule for every `/64`.

Becoming a Hacker Foundations has two `/56`s 
[delegated to it](https://console.cloud.google.com/networking/byoip/list?invt=Abms5A&project=gcp-asigbahgcp-nprd-47930)
in `us-east1`, one prefix is for `/64` Load Balancer Forwarding Rules, the
other is for
[Subnets](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/reference/rest/v1/subnetworks/insert)
and to assign to hosts in GCE:

* `2602:80a:f004:200::/56`:
  * Name: `asig-bah-prod-us-east1-nlb-2602-80a-f004-200-56`
  * Mode: `EXTERNAL_IPV6_FORWARDING_RULE_CREATION`
* `2602:80a:f004:300::/56`
  * Name: `asig-bah-prod-us-east1-net-2602-80a-f004-300-56`
  * Mode: `EXTERNAL_IPV6_SUBNETWORK_CREATION`

Example using `gloud` CLI:

```
$ gcloud compute public-delegated-prefixes describe asig-bah-prod-us-east1-nlb-2602-80a-f004-200-56

```

## Start Labs

* You can either ask the students to start the labs themselves, or you can start
  all labs from the Dashboard, Choose `Rows per Page: All`, Select All,
  then `Start`.
  
## Troubleshooting

### cty.StringVal("STARTED")

If you see an error like this:
```
│ Error: Provider produced inconsistent result after apply
│
│ When applying changes to module.pod[1].cml2_lifecycle.top, provider
| "provider[\"registry.terraform.io/ciscodevnet/cml2\"]" produced an unexpected
| new value: .state: was cty.StringVal("DEFINED_ON_CORE"), but now
| cty.StringVal("STARTED").
```
It means you're trying to change labs that are currently running.  You have to
stop and wipe them before making kinds of changes.

* Stop all labs from the Dashboard, Choose `Rows per Page: All`, Select All,
  then `Stop`, followed by `Wipe`, then `tofu apply` again:

```
tofu apply
```

* If this doesn't fix it, delete the single applicable pod in the error message
  and reapply (note, this is the second pod):

> [!WARNING]
> This is a destructive operation and the students in the pod will lose any
> changes they've made.

```
tofu destroy -target 'module.pod[1]'
```
```
tofu apply
```

If this still doesn't fix it, delete all the pods and start over:

> [!WARNING]
> This is a destructive operation and the whole class will have to restart
> their labs and will lose any changes they've made.

> [!CAUTION]
> If you destroy the entire lab deployment, e.g. `tofu destroy &&
> tofu apply`, all the student passwords will be changed unless you
> explicitly set them with the `cml_credentials.json` file in the workspace
> root.

```
tofu destroy -target 'module.pod'
```
```
tofu apply
```

### Lab is not in DEFINED_ON_CORE state

For this error:
```
│ Error: CML2 Provider Error
│
│ lab is not in DEFINED_ON_CORE state
```
Wipe the pod, and try again.  Let's say it's pod 1 you want to recreate:

```
tofu destroy -target module.pod[0]
tofu apply
```

### Lab compute hosts have been preempted and the cluster is an unhealthy state

The symptoms are the cluster is unhealthy, and some/all lab nodes are in a
`DISCONNECTED` state signified by an orange chain link icon with a white slash
through it.

> [!WARNING]
> This is a destructive scenario for those pods affected and will have to
> restart their labs and will lose any changes they've made.  It is recommended
> not provisioning the compute nodes as Spot for a class.  Reserve Spot for
> off-times.  You can change the provisioning model on-the-fly without
> rebuilding by changing the Template from the instance group manager **and
> deleting** the existing compute machines to reprovision them.

#### Recovery

As far as what it takes to recover, these are the steps:

* In [CML node administration](https://becomingahacker.com/system_admin/nodes), filter by state `DISCONNECTED`, select All, then **Stop** and **Wipe** the nodes.  This will remove them from that compute node.
* In [CML compute hosts](https://becomingahacker.com/system_admin/compute_hosts), select the `Disconnected` host (with the red X state), change the admission state to `REGISTERED`, then choose `DECOMMISSION`, then chose `REMOVE`.
* The System Health should return back to green.
* In the [Google Compute Engine Instance Groups](https://console.cloud.google.com/compute/instanceGroups/list?inv=1&invt=AbyRIA&project=gcp-asigbahgcp-nprd-47930), choose the `cml-instance-group-manager-XXXXXX`, chose the VM that was preempted in the compute hosts above, then delete the node(s).
* The `Target running size` will shrink by the number of nodes you delete.  Set it back to the desired state by `Edit`ing the instance group manager and set back to the desired target size.
* New nodes will be created, and they will automatically be registered in CML.  Just be patient.  It takes a couple of minutes.
* Monitor the [CML Cluster Status](https://becomingahacker.com/diagnostics/cluster_status) page and wait for the system to return to normal and all services are healthy
* Have the students start their lab pods, if desired.
#### Long Term Fix

* The root cause is when a machine is preempted, it's stopped by Google, and the machine's [local storage on SSDs is lost](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/disks/local-ssd#data_persistence).  This state can be preserved by Google, but that's a relatively new feature in Preview at the time of writing and we aren't using it.  We use Local Storage for running labs because the performance is 100x better than running on mounted disks (like EBS if you're familiar with AWS).  It seriously makes a huge difference.
* The [machine](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/preemptible#preemption-process) needs to recognize it's being [preempted](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/create-use-preemptible#detecting_if_an_instance_was_preempted), and not just with an ordinary shutdown.  The Google Guest Agent can run [scripts](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/guest-agent?tab=readme-ov-file#metadata-scripts) during a shutdown.  See this [Stack Overflow Post](https://stackoverflow.com/a/57862925/29463184) for details.
* This script can query the machine preemption state from the metadata server with `curl "http://metadata.google.internal/computeMetadata/v1/instance/preempted" -H "Metadata-Flavor: Google"` and check for a return value of `TRUE`.  If the target state is `TRUE` the server has been preempted and Google will destroy the instance in or around *30 seconds*.
* Next the script should [**Stop** and **Wipe**](https://developer.cisco.com/docs/modeling-labs/deleting-labs/) all its [resident Nodes with the appropriate compute ID](https://becomingahacker.com/api/v0/ui/#/Nodes) with the CML controller (as shown in the recovery steps above, but using the [APIs](https://becomingahacker.com/api/v0/ui/#/System)), and deregister itself before committing Seppuku.  When CML stops a node, it doesn't stop them gracefully with the current version and it's relatively quick.  This API needs privileged credentials and the compute nodes should probably each have their own, rather than using a common one.
* The compute host will die, and the instance group manager will restart the node in the same availability zone with the same boot disk.  This means the compute node may stay down if there are no more resources, but this is rare.  The compute node will register itself and be available for use with labs and nodes.  This step will likely need some further fixes.  The instance group manager likely needs some tweaks to do some health checking to force recreations in different zones in the region.
